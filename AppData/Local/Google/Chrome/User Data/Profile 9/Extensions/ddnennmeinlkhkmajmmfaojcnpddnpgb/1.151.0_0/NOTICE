Npcap OEM
=========

The distribution of this product may bundle [Npcap](https://npcap.org), a
packet capturing/sending library, which has the following notices.

Libpcap Portable Packet Capturing Library
-----------------------------------------

**Description**: Libpcap is a popular reference implementation of the pcap
packet capturing API.  It is produced by The Tcpdump Group and supports Linux
and Mac OS X systems (among others).  Npcap implements this API for Microsoft
Windows by combining the high-level open source libpcap API code with our own
custom Windows driver that implements the low-level network operations.  Our
wpcap.dll library file is mostly Libpcap code.  We occasionally make our own
fixes and changes to the libpcap code, but we have a great relationship with
The Tcpdump Group and try to submit all of our changes to them for
incorporation in future libpcap releases.

**Software URL**: <http://www.tcpdump.org/>

**Version used**: 1.10

**License Summary**: Modified BSD license (3-clause) -- allows free
 redistribution as long as you include a short attribution statement and
 warranty disclaimer somewhere in your documentation.

**License Text:**

Winpcap Windows Packet Capturing Library
----------------------------------------

**Description**: Winpcap is an earlier (now abandoned) open source
implementation of the pcap API for Windows.  The last Winpcap release was made
in March 2013.  We created Npcap by starting with that abandoned code and
updating it to support modern Windows NDIS API's and fixing well-known bugs
and security issues.  While Npcap has diverged substantially over the years,
it still contains a substantial amount of original Winpcap code, so the
Winpcap license must be followed.  is used by Nmap on Windows for raw packet
reading during host discovery, port scanning, and OS detection. It is a
derivative of LibPcap, so that license (see Libpcap section) must be followed
as well. It is only needed and used on Windows.

**Software URL**: <https://www.winpcap.org/>

**Version used**: 4.1.3

**License Summary**: Modified BSD license (3-clause) -- allows free
redistribution as long as you include attribution statement and warranty
disclaimer somewhere in your documentation. The fourth clause, which relates
to attribution in advertising materials has been officially removed and
revoked by the University of California, Berkeley:
<https://ipira.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/docs/Advertising_clause_removed_from_BSD_license.pdf>

**License Text:**

This was taken from <https://www.winpcap.org/misc/copyright.htm> on March 11,
2016 and we made the following updates:

-  Removed the "advertising clause" from University of California, Berkeley
   copyright statement because they have officiall removed and revoked that as
   documented here:
   <https://ipira.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/docs/Advertising_clause_removed_from_BSD_license.pdf>
-  Removed copyright notice from Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan because that code
   is no longer in Npcap.
-  Removed copyright notice from Yen Yen Lim and north Dakota State University
   because that code is no longer in Npcap.
-  Removed copyright notice from Digital Equipment Corporation because that
   code is no longer in Npcap.
-  Removed copyright notice from WIDE Project because that code is no longer in
   Npcap.
-  Removed copyright notice from Juniper Networks because that code is no
   longer in Npcap.
-  Removed copyright notice from Daniel Hartmeier since that code is no longer
   in Npcap.
-  Removed copyright notice from Carnegie Mellon since that code is no longer
   in Npcap.
-  Removed the 1983 copyright notice from UC Berkeley since that code is no
   longer in Npcap. The notice from their 1990's contributions is still there.
